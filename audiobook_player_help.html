<h2>How to load audiobooks</h2>
<p>

At least one directory has to be set up in the application. In this directory, each audiobook has to be stored in its own directory.<br/>
Recognized audio file format are:
<ul>
<li>MP3
<li>OGG
<li>WAV
</ul>

<h3>How <b>Audiobook Player</b> recognizes series</h3>

<b>Audiobook Player</b> uses the name of the directory containing the audiobook to recognize data about it.<br/>
The following patterns can be recognized:
<ul>
<li> <i>Author name</i> - <i>Audiobook title</i> (<i>Series name</i> <i>Index of audiobook in series</i>). For example, "G. R. R. Martin - Game of thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire 1)" would create an audiobook titled "Game of thrones", by "G. R. R. Martin", audiobook nÂ°1 of "A Song of Ice and Fire".
<li> <i>Author name</i> - <i>Audiobook title</i>. For example, "G. R. R. Martin - Game of thrones" would create an audiobook titled "Game of thrones", by "G. R. R. Martin".
